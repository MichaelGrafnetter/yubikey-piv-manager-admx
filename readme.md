== Administrative Template for YubiKey PIV Manager
This ADMX administrative template allows administrators to easily deploy configuration of the [YubiKey PIV Manager](https://github.com/Yubico/yubikey-piv-manager) through Active Directory Group Policy. It can also be used on standalone computers to unlock some features of the PIV Manager that are disabled by default, like controlling the Pin and Touch policies. The affected registry locations are documented at [Yubico's website](https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-piv-manager/Settings_and_Group_Policy.html).
